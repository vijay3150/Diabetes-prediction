# Diabetes-prediction
ABOUT THE FILE AND USE

The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Diabetes Prediction with ML Models GOAL

The goal of this exercise is to identify the parameters that influences the diabetes attack and build a ML model for the prediction of diabetes attack. DATASET
